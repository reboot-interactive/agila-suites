# Agila Suites

**Self-hosted multi-marketplace ERP** for sellers running across Lazada, Shopee, TikTok Shop, Shopify, OpenCart, Venta, and more — all from one dashboard.

Open-core distribution: the Community tier is free and AGPL-licensed; advanced features (campaigns, vouchers, advanced analytics, premium integrations) are sold as paid Plus modules.

## Why Agila Suites

Filipino multi-channel sellers typically juggle Lazada, Shopee, TikTok, and their own webstore — three browser tabs, three sets of credentials, three reconciliation processes. Agila Suites centralizes the daily operations:

- **One catalog** that pushes consistent prices, SKUs, and stock to every connected marketplace
- **One unified order list** with marketplace badges, profit per order, and stock auto-deducted
- **One reporting layer** that computes profitability across platforms
- **One purchasing workflow** for restocking, multi-currency POs, and vendor management

Built for self-hosting: you run it on your own server, you own the data, you control the upgrade cadence.

---

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+ with extensions: `mbstring`, `pdo_mysql`, `zip`, `gd` or `imagick`, `xml`, `curl`
- MySQL 8.0+ (or MariaDB 10.6+)
- Composer 2+
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for asset rebuilds; pre-built assets ship in the zip)
- Web server: nginx or Apache with PHP-FPM

---

## Installation

**Drag-and-drop install on most modern hosting panels.** The Community zip ships with `vendor/` bundled and a top-level `.htaccess` shim, so you don't need SSH, composer, or DocumentRoot reconfiguration.

```
1. Download → click "Code → Download ZIP" at the top of this page
2. Upload    → put the zip in your hosting panel's public_html/
3. Extract   → right-click → Extract in cPanel / HestiaCP File Manager
4. Database  → create a MySQL database + user in your hosting panel
5. Visit     → open https://your-domain.com/ in a browser
6. Wizard    → the setup wizard appears; walk through the 6 steps
7. Login     → use the credentials you created in step 6
```

That's it. Marketplace API credentials (Lazada, Shopee, TikTok) are configured through the Settings pages inside the app after install.

For per-panel walkthroughs (HestiaCP, cPanel, CyberPanel, Plesk) and manual install via SSH, see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

## Cron jobs

Add to your crontab for marketplace sync and token refresh:

```
*  *    * * *   /usr/bin/php /path/to/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

The Laravel scheduler runs the per-marketplace sync, token refresh, and stock push commands at appropriate intervals.

---

## Development

Run server, queue worker, log viewer, and Vite hot-reload concurrently:

```bash
composer dev
```

---

## Architecture

Agila Suites is **modular by design**. Each marketplace integration lives under `extensions/{name}/` with its own:

- Manifest (`extension.json`)
- Service provider class
- Controllers, Models, Services
- Routes, views, migrations
- Permissions

Extensions register themselves via the `IntegrationRegistry` and contribute to core surfaces (orders list, dashboard, mobile API, layout banner) via well-defined contracts (`IntegrationProvider`, `OrderImagesContributor`, `DashboardContributor`, etc.). Adding a new marketplace requires no core code changes.

This same architecture supports **third-party developers** building their own integrations, and powers the Plus-tier paid modules.

---

## Updates

Community customers get free security and bug-fix updates for the latest major version. Major version upgrades may include migration steps documented in `UPGRADE.md`.

Plus customers receive 1 year of feature updates from purchase date.
